// This is the final, correct, and simplest possible version for modern Flutter.
// It simply extends the standard Flutter activity.
// The Flutter engine will automatically handle the registration of all plugins
// (including your custom screen_time_channel and workmanager) when this
// activity is created. No manual intervention is needed.

    // No code is needed inside the class.
