The Communication Strategy: Turning Confusion into a "Smart" Feature
We will use a combination of a proactive push notification and a persistent in-app banner to guide the user through the transition. This turns a potentially negative edge case into a moment where the app can demonstrate its intelligence and build user trust.
Layer 1: The Proactive Alert (Acknowledge the Change)
This is the first and most important step. The moment the system detects the timezone mismatch, we need to alert the user.
The Trigger: This is a server-side trigger. When the app syncs from a new location, the server will compare the reported timezone (Europe/London) with the day's locked-in timezone (America/New_York). If they are significantly different (e.g., >2 hours offset), the server will trigger a push notification via a service like Supabase's built-in push notification provider or a dedicated service.
Why Server-Side? A server-side trigger is more reliable and prevents the notification from firing repeatedly if the user opens and closes the app multiple times.
The Notification Content: The tone should be helpful and welcoming, not technical or alarming.
Title: Welcome to London! üá¨üáß
Body: ScreenPledge has updated to your new timezone. Your current goal day is still running on New York time and will reset at 5:00 AM your time.
Result: The user is immediately informed. There is no surprise. They understand that something is different and that the app is aware of their travel.
Layer 2: The In-App Contextual Banner (Explain the "Limbo")
A push notification can be easily dismissed. For the entire duration of the "limbo" period, we need a persistent, clear reminder inside the app itself.
The Trigger: As soon as the app receives the "timezone mismatch" signal from the server (or detects it locally after the first sync), it will display a special banner at the top of the Dashboard.
The Banner Design: This should be a non-intrusive, dismissible banner. The most effective version would include a countdown.
Text Wireframe for the Dashboard Banner:

Code
//====================================================================//
// [UI ELEMENT: Timezone Transition Banner]
//====================================================================//

// [Icon: ‚úàÔ∏è or üåç] **New Timezone Detected**
//
// Your daily goal is still synced to your previous timezone.
// A fresh start for your new day begins in:
//
// [ 04 : 23 : 15 ]
// Hours : Mins : Secs
//
// [ A small "Dismiss" (X) button ]
//====================================================================//
Result: Every time the user opens the app between landing and the 5:00 AM reset, they have a clear, unambiguous explanation for why their day hasn't reset yet. The countdown turns a confusing wait into a clear and predictable event.
Layer 3: The "Fresh Start" Confirmation (Confirm Normalcy)
The final step is to close the loop and confirm to the user that everything is back to normal. This builds confidence and completes the guided experience.
The Trigger: The first time the user opens the app after the daily reset has occurred (e.g., at 5:01 AM London time).
The Communication: The persistent banner will be gone. We can replace it with a one-time, celebratory "toast" notification or a simple welcome back message on the dashboard.
Example Toast Message:
‚úÖ Your daily goal has now reset to your local London time. Have a great day!
Result: The user feels a sense of resolution. The app has successfully guided them through a complex transition and confirmed that everything is working as expected.
Summary: A Cohesive User Journey
By implementing this three-layer communication strategy, we transform the "Early Morning Reset" problem from a point of friction into a feature:
Acknowledge: A friendly push notification welcomes them and acknowledges their travel.
Explain: A persistent in-app banner with a countdown clearly explains the temporary "limbo" period.
Confirm: A final, simple message confirms that the transition is complete and everything is back to normal.
This approach is the perfect embodiment of the "Delightful Discipline" principle. It takes a potentially confusing technical constraint and wraps it in a thoughtful, proactive, and user-centric communication layer that makes the app feel smart, reliable, and truly on the user's side.
